      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Hello, my name is Jason Peabody, I’m from Houston Texas and I design websites. My website plan for your business is to keep constant recent photos of merchandise and booth setup. We can also keep tabs and updated pages that show when and where your company will be selling around the country. We also will keep updated contact information on the website as well. The final page for the website would be a page that shows what merchandise you do and doesn’t have in stock. Also potentially including a merchandise request forum.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>[the audience is the people that will be attending and shopping in our booth at comic conventions. They can use the website to see when and where they can find us, along with other information.]</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <p>
        Why will people come to your site?
        The purpose of my website is to inform the customers that attend comic conventions and are either familiar or new to my family’s booth when and where in the country and at what specific shows we will be at, along with some contact information so that if desired, they can get in contact with us in order to see if we have certain merchandise, or to request certain merchandise. Visitors will come to our website in order to gain more information about our company and all the conventions we will be a part of throughout the country.
        What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?
        The questions that my site is designed to answer, is really any question that the visitor may have, regarding the whereabouts and inventory of our company. They will be able to reach out and get in contact with one of the owners and get any question they could have answered. Through the site, we will attach a screen shot of an excel spreadsheet that contains all the shows and places that our company will have a booth along with a few images of what our booth generally looks like and some merchandise images.

        What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?
        his website is designed to be mostly informational. There wont be a lot of user interactions with the website besides the navigation of the website itself. This website is more of a place holder than anything until we can get a website with a live store up and running. The design is just to show where and when the company will be, and different contact methods along with possibly social media links. There will be images of the booth and of merchandise that will be visible and can be interacted with via hovering the mouse over the image. 
        What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?
        The only information that my site will require is information input on my end. I need to keep updated images and information about the shows that our company will appear at. The visitors of the website will not input any information on their end. This website is purely informational and does not require much to any interaction between the user and the website itself. The most the user will have to do is navigate through the tabs and pages of the website to get access to the information that they need. There may be potential in the future to include a forum where the visitors of the website can ask questions and interact directly with the owners of the company without having to personally contact them. But for the extent of this project and its requirements, This page will stick to being purely informational.

      <h3>About Us and Contact info</h3>
      <p>
        Why will your visitors come to your site to get this information or complete the actions.
        Over the years of running our booth. I’ve personally seen that due to our friendly nature and recognizable and unique merchandise and branding, people tend to remember our booth and seek us out specifically for the merchandise that we sell. We constantly get asked if we have an online store or website where customers can visit and either view products or purchase them. Having this website will be a great place holder until we can get an online store up and running, so that customers can at least see where were going to be at and have full access to all of our contact information. This website can go
