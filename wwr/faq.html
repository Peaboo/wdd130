                <h2>Is whitewater rafting safe?</h2>
                <p>Whitewater rafting is a fun summer activity with a range of difficulties for almost all ages and abilities, but as with any activity there are inherent risks and you will need to sign a waiver to participate. You have taken the first step of mitigating that risk by researching an experienced outfitter. Certain river trips have less risk than others and choosing an appropriate level of whitewater for your group is critical.</p>

                <h5>What should I wear?</h5>
                <p>The biggest thing is to check weather conditions. Being prepared is the best way to keep warm. Check to see what the water and air temperatures are. If you add the air temp, adjusted for wind chill, and the water temp together, and they equal less than 100 degrees Fahrenheit, you are in prime hypothermia conditions. You can get current weather, water level, and water temperatures from the National Weather Service.</p>

                <h5>What should I bring?</h5>
                <p>Both top and bottom water proof rain gear will protect you from rain and rapid splash. Sometimes the rain is nice and a splash in the rapids is just what you need to cool yourself down, but there are days when it’s just too cold to get wet.
                    Layers of synthetic or wool clothing. Early and late season trips have days that start and end cold and often have long spells of travel in the shaded canyon.
                    Waterproof Sunscreen – SPF30 or higher recommended.
                    Lip balm with SPF. Try to find one on a cord to attach it to your gear or life jacket.
                    Recreational Sport Sandals – open so water drains, but with a non-slip sole. They should offer good support like Teva or Chaco. Steer away from the floppy beach shoe.
                    Camera and an extra memory card or two. To keep the water away, a zip top bag will usually suffice (bring an extra one in case it tears). If you want to make the jump and officially own some rafting gear, you can always buy a small waterproof bag.
                    Water bottle. We recommend stainless steel. Please don’t bring those newfangled glass water bottles with the rubber protection.
                    Sunglasses with retention string.
                    Sun hat with retention clips to attach to shirt or life jacket so it doesn’t fly off and become one with the white water.</p>
